This project builds an end-to-end data pipeline for analyzing chat data from Noora Health's Remote Engagement Service. It includes data ingestion, transformation, validation, and visualization using various tools such as Amazon S3, Airbyte, PostgreSQL, and Metabase.
Mentioned all the details regarding how to run datapipeline end to end in read_me.txt file.
For all the queries with explanation please refer document.txt file.
